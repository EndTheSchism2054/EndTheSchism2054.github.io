  <h1>Welcome to #EndTheSchism2054</h1>
  <p>We are a community dedicated to ending all schism and division within Christendom and promoting unity. We will be providing resources on what more you can do shortly. In the meantime please read the founding document A Call to Prayer and the About page FAQ. The website is new and the language used is preliminary; as such, everything on the website (especially wording) is subject to change within the next few months to ensure the integrity of our mission and its compliance with the will of God. Read the founding document A Call to Prayer, which is the bedrock of the movement. Some wording in the founding document, however, is subject to change to ensure its compliance with the will of God in consultation with clergy of all backgrounds and orders, theologians, and concerned laity. We thought it fitting to launch on Easter, which is why the website is still a work in progress; however, it will come together as the hours continue through Easter and into the next few weeks. Have a joyous Easter with your family and friends and spread the word about #EndTheSchism2054! Alleluia! Alleluia! Christ is Risen! He is Risen Indeed! Alleluia!  Alleluia!</p>

  <h3 style="color:red;">Immediate Action: The Apostles Fast for 2023</h3>
  <h4 style="color:blue;">Western Churches: June 5 - June 29 | Eastern Churches: June 12 - July 11</h4>
  <p>You can take immediate action by participating in the upcoming Apostles Fast in accordance with the dates and fasting rules observed by your church. This is a fast once done by all Christians, 
	but fell out of practice in some regions after the Great Schism. You need not fast from food during the Apostles Fast; but, instead set aside something to moderate or remove from your life for a 
	time, such that you instead dedicate that time to prayer or almsgiving.</p>

  <h2>End the 1054 Schism by 2054</h2>
  <h3>Praying for Unity in the Church</h3>
  <p>The 1054 Schism, also known as the East-West Schism, divided the Christian Church into Eastern (Orthodox) and Western (Roman Catholic) branches. For over 900 years, Christians have been separated by this schism and it is time for us to come together in humility and prayer.</p>
  <p>Our goal is to end the schism by the year 2054 through humility, forgiveness, and a commitment to unity. We believe that through prayer and repentance, we can heal the wounds of the past and come together as one body in Christ.</p>
  <p>As a means of supporting this movement, we encourage all people to read and understand Jesus' prayer "that they may be one" (John 17:21). We also encourage everyone to pray for unity in the church. We will be compiling a list of prayers shortly from across traditions (in fact, the list has already begun, it just has not been uploaded yet due to this being a very fresh movement and website); however, if you are not sure where to start, we encourage you to pray the short Prayer of Archbishop William Laud as a means of supporting the movement to end the 1054 Schism by 2054. By collectively praying for unity in the Church, we can make a powerful impact in bringing about the healing of the schism.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>O gracious Father, we humbly beseech thee for thy holy Catholic Church; that thou wouldest be pleased to fill it with all truth, in all peace. Where it is corrupt, purify it; where it is in error, direct it; where in any thing it is amiss, reform it. Where it is right, establish it; where it is in want, provide for it; where it is divided, reunite it; for the sake of him who died and rose again, and ever liveth to make intercession for us, Jesus Christ, thy Son, our Lord. Amen.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Join us in this movement by praying for unity in the Church and sharing this message with others. Use the hashtag <span class="cross">&#10013;</span><code>#EndTheSchism2054</code> on social media to spread awareness and show your support. </p>
