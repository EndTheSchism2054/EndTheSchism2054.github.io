<h2>#EndTheSchism2054 FAQ</h2>
    <div class="question">What is #EndTheSchism2054?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      #EndTheSchism2054 is a prayer movement made up of members of the Body of Christ, as well as those who wish to be members of the Body of Christ, from across traditions and backgrounds. The namesake of #EndTheSchism2054, the East-West Schism of 1054, is not the sole target of the #EndTheSchism2054 movement. Our aim is to end all schisms through prayer and fasting, but first and foremost the 1054 Schism. If the 1054 Schism is healed, the healing of many others will follow. One thousand years of separation is long enough.
    </div>
    <div class="question">What is the goal of #EndTheSchism2054?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      The goal of #EndTheSchism2054 is to bring all Christians together in true unity of faith, where differences are not ignored or swept under the rug, but rather identified and worked through in order to bring light to the truth. It has to start with forgiveness first, for past sins and crimes; then we have to cast away pride and come together in humility, asking for guidance in unifying the Church. This true unity may seem impossible; however, we believe that it is achievable through God's mercy and grace. This can only happen if we choose to cooperate with His grace and the Holy Spirit, which we must humbly ask for through prayer and fasting.
    </div>
    <div class="question">What does #EndTheSchism2054 believe about unity?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      #EndTheSchism2054 believes in a true unity of shared faith, as described in 1 Corinthians 1:10: "I appeal to you, brothers and sisters, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree with one another in what you say and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be perfectly united in mind and thought." This kind of unity requires not merely putting aside our differences, but examining, understanding, and working them out under the guidance of the Holy Spirit. 

    </div>
    <div class="question">How will this unity come about with such staunch aversion to unity, through both theological differences and pride?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      To be clear, we are not just hoping for the beneficial psychological effects of people praying towards the same end, and being more cooperative in working out differences. If it is the Lord's will, we hope for some divine intervention. Jesus wanted us to have unity, and prayed for our unity; yet we like doing the opposite. If we align ourselves with His will and cooperate with His grace, then it may be possible to reverse the damage. Once again, it has to start with forgiveness first, for past sins and crimes; then we have to cast away pride and come together in humility, asking for guidance in unifying the Church. Whether that be through the Holy Spirit in us all, subtly guiding us towards unity and truth, or it be by some other means (or combination of means) it is not our job to know. When we are lost as to how to do something, we are supposed to go to God for help. Jesus in Matthew 17:20 says, "For truly, I say to you, if you have faith like a grain of mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move, and nothing will be impossible for you." Some of us know the truth in this verse more than others. We must have faith that the Schisms will be healed in order for this to work. Jesus tells us as much in Mark 11:24-25, "24 Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours. 25 And whenever you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone, so that your Father also who is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.'" Jesus prayed for it, so we have no excuse as to why we shouldn't in an organized manner, "40 And he came to the disciples and found them sleeping. And he said to Peter, 'So, could you not watch with me one hour?'"(Matthew 26:40).

    <div class="question">What can I do to support #EndTheSchism2054?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      There are many ways to support #EndTheSchism2054! First and foremost, you can pray and fast for unity among Christians. You can also engage in dialogue with Christians from different traditions 
	  and seek to understand their perspectives. Additionally, you can spread the word about #EndTheSchism2054 on social media or in your community, and encourage others to join the movement. Finally,
	  you can practice the Apostles Fast, to be dedicated in prayer for the healing of Schisms. This is because the Apostles Fast initially commemorated the unity found in the Apostles Peter and Paul 
	  in founding the Church, which included prayers for Missionaries and the growth of the Church, but largely fell out of practice in the West. Peter was the Apostle to the Jewish people and to the West, Paul was the Apostle to the Gentiles and to the East. In them, 
	  we find the kind of true unity we seek. Interestingly, it was at the end of the first day of the Apostles Fast July 16, 1054 that the Patriarch of Constantinople, Michael Cerularius, was 
	  excommunicated; furthering one of the most damaging Schisms in history. It is for this reason that we choose the Apostles Fast as the season of prayer and repentance.
