	<h2 style="color:red;">Immediate Action: The Apostles Fast for 2023</h2>
	<h3 style="color:blue;">Western Churches: June 5 - June 29 | Eastern Churches: June 12 - July 11</h3>
	
	<p>You can take immediate action by participating in the upcoming Apostles Fast in accordance with the dates and fasting rules observed by your church. This is a fast once done by all Christians, 
	but fell out of practice in some regions after the Great Schism. You need not fast from food during the Apostles Fast; but, instead set aside something to moderate or remove from your life for a 
	time, such that you instead dedicate that time to prayer or almsgiving.</p>
	
	<p>Here at #EndTheSchism2054, we implore you to practice the Apostles Fast and spread word of it to friends, family, and your local church; to be dedicated in prayer for the healing of Schisms. 
	This is because the Apostles Fast initially commemorated the unity found in the Apostles Peter and Paul in 
	founding the Church, which included prayers for Missionaries and the growth of the Church, but largely fell out of practice in the West. Peter was the Apostle to the Jewish people and to the West, Paul was the Apostle to the Gentiles and to the East. In them, we 
	find the kind of true unity we seek. Interestingly, it was at the end of the first day of the Apostles Fast July 16, 1054 that the Patriarch of Constantinople, Michael Cerularius, was 
	excommunicated; furthering one of the most damaging Schisms in history. It is for this reason that we choose the Apostles Fast as the season of prayer and repentance.</p>
	
	<p>If you are Protestant, you will likely want to use the date for the Western Churches (June 5 - June 29) unless, due to local custom in certain regions, you wish to participate in the dates for 
	the Eastern Churches (June 12 - July 11).</p>
	
	<h3> How should I practice this fast if my church has no prescribed rules for fasting? </h3>
	<p>Well, you fast to your strength, you don't go overboard. When in doubt ask your pastor. Its not really about the rule, but about the heart and intent. It is supposed to be a lighter fast than 
	Lent. The Book of Common Prayer (an Anglican resource) suggests that Western fasting would be that you have a break from the fast on Sundays (because every Sunday is a mini Easter), and then 
	reduce your consumption, pray, self-examine, and preform acts of mercy (charity, almsgiving, etc.). No meat would also be a typical Western thing, though that could be expanded to no animal 
	products if you feel adventurous; however, you fast to your strength/ability (and you are supposed to hospitably eat what is put in front of you by others). Things like fish are also 
	permitted in Western fasting (the Western rule is that if the meat doesn't have blood, then it is good to eat).
	<br/>
	<br/>
	The problem is that the Apostles Fast has been out of practice in the West for quite some time, so there is a lack of resources on it from the Western tradition; however, you could look to what the Eastern 
	Orthodox/Byzantine Catholics do for inspiration (though that tends to be quite strict). 
	<br/>
	<br/>
	This is the first year that we are all trying to do this together in a long time; so we are just kind of winging it. If these fasting suggestions seem too daunting, then give up one little 
	thing and pray, and do things with great heart. It could be social media, gaming, binge watching television, podcasts, radio, or even just the amount of coffee you consume in the morning. If 
	you cannot fast, then you can pray for the strength of others in their fasts this year. For we are in an unseen battle and the enemy of our souls does not want any of this to happen.
